# What We Changed and Why

## 🗄️ PostgreSQL Migration (from SQLite)

**Why**: SQLite struggles with 500K+ images and doesn't support vector similarity search.

**What Changed**:
- Complete database layer rewrite to PostgreSQL 16+ with pgvector extension
- Docker-based deployment (`docker-compose.yml` included)
- Connection pooling for high concurrency (50 connections)
- Thread-safe caching to prevent connection pool exhaustion
- Snake_case column naming convention for PostgreSQL compatibility
- 11 partial class files for modular DataStore organization

**Benefits**:
- Scales to 1M+ images without performance degradation
- Enables semantic/vector similarity search
- Better concurrent access for background operations
- Production-ready database with proper backup tools (`pg_dump`)

## ⚡ Two-Phase Scanning System

**Why**: Scanning 500K images took 4-8 hours, blocking all operations.

**What Changed**:
- **Phase 1 (Quick Scan)**: Index basic file info in 10-20 minutes
- **Phase 2 (Deep Scan)**: Extract full metadata in background
- New `scan_phase` column tracks completion status
- PostgreSQL COPY command for bulk inserts (~1000 files/second)

**Benefits**:
- Browse your library immediately after Phase 1
- Background metadata extraction doesn't block usage
- Progressive enhancement as metadata becomes available

## 🏷️ AI Auto-Tagging & Captioning (NEW)

**Why**: Manually tagging thousands of images is impractical.

**What Changed**:
- **Multi-GPU Batch Worker Architecture**: Parallel processing across multiple GPUs with optimized batch scheduling
- **Dual Tagging System**:
  - **JoyTag**: Fast booru-style tag prediction using ONNX Runtime
  - **WDv3 Large**: High-accuracy anime/illustration tagging
- **JoyCaption**: Natural language image descriptions with 6 caption type options via LLamaSharp
- GPU acceleration with CUDA 12.x and cuDNN 9.x support
- **Performance**: Tagging speeds consistently at **0.034s/image with 30 workers**
- Configurable confidence thresholds
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Tags stored in PostgreSQL and optionally written to image metadata

**Benefits**:
- Automatic tag generation for searchability with choice between two complementary taggers
- Natural language captions for semantic search with multiple caption style options (6 types)
- GPU-accelerated inference at scale with multi-worker batch processing
- No external API required - runs locally
- High throughput for large collections: 30 images/second across distributed workers

## 👤 Face Recognition & Clustering (NEW)

**Why**: Finding specific characters or people across 1M+ images is impossible with text prompts alone, especially with inconsistent naming in metadata.

**What Changed**:
- **YOLO11 Face Detection**: High-speed, high-accuracy face localization using YOLO11-face ONNX models.
- **ArcFace Embeddings**: Generates 512-dimensional identity embeddings for every detected face using ResNet-50/100.
- **pgvector Identity Search**: Store and query face embeddings using cosine similarity in PostgreSQL.
- **Automated Clustering**: Group similar faces into "Person" clusters automatically based on embedding distance.
- **Face Gallery UI**: 
  - Dedicated "Face Recognition" tab in Metadata Panel.
  - View all detected faces in an image with crops.
  - Edit person labels and manage clusters directly.
  - Quality-based filtering (sharpness, confidence, pose).

**Benefits**:
- Find every image of a specific person/character regardless of prompt.
- Clean up inconsistent metadata by labeling clusters once.
- Identify "unknown" recurring characters in your collection.
- Filter by face quality to find the best shots for training LoRAs.

### Caption Provider Abstraction (Local + OpenAI-Compatible API)

- Introduced `ICaptionService` with two implementations:
   - `JoyCaptionService` (local, LLamaSharp + GGUF/LLaVA models)
   - `HttpCaptionService` (external, OpenAI-compatible HTTP API e.g., LM Studio, Ollama, cloud)
- Provider selection added to Settings: `Local JoyCaption` or `OpenAI-Compatible HTTP API`.
- When an external provider is selected:
   - Base URL, Model, and optional API Key fields are available.
   - A new “Test Connection” button probes `/v1/models` or `/models`, falling back to `/v1/chat/completions`.
   - On success, the models list is parsed and used to populate a Model dropdown (editable ComboBox).
   - “Send Sample Image” lets you pick an image and receive a caption using the currently configured provider.
- TaggingWindow now calls `ServiceLocator.CaptionService` so the UI is provider‑agnostic.

### Caption Handling Modes

- New setting: `CaptionHandlingMode` with options: Overwrite, Append, Refine.
- Applied when saving captions returned by JoyCaption or the external provider.
- Mode is honored consistently across manual captioning and batch operations.

### Tag + Caption UX Improvements

- Image Preview: Added a “Tags/Caption” tab with quick copy buttons to copy tags, caption, and parameters.
- Context Menu: Split the single action into two entries:
   - “Auto‑Tag…” → opens TaggingWindow with tagging options only (JoyTag / WDv3 Large)
   - “Caption…” → opens TaggingWindow with captioning options only (JoyCaption / HTTP API)
- TaggingWindow supports mode flags (`taggingOnly`, `captioningOnly`) that tailor the UI (title, enabled checkboxes) to the chosen operation.

### Tag Deduplication Overhaul

- Precomputed `tag_deduplication_map.json` generated from JoyTag and WDv3 Large lists to normalize common aliases.
- Centralized deduplication in the PostgreSQL DataStore layer so duplicates are eliminated regardless of source:
   - Auto‑tagging
   - Sidecar ingestion
   - Manual edits/imports
- Ensures consistent tags across the library even when mixing taggers and sources.

## 🧠 Multi-Modal Embedding System (4 Embedding Models)

**Why**: Enable semantic search and ComfyUI workflow integration.

**What Changed**:
Added multiple embedding vectors per image stored in pgvector:

| Embedding | Model | Dimensions | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|------------|---------|
| Prompt & Tags | BGE-large-en-v1.5 | 1024D | Natural language prompt search, tag embeddings |
| Captions | BGE-large-en-v1.5 | 1024D | Search by generated captions |
| Visual Similarity | CLIP-ViT-H/14 | 1024D | Visual similarity search & IPAdapter integration |
| SDXL CLIP-L | Stable Diffusion CLIP-L | 768D | Direct ComfyUI conditioning for prompts, tags & captions |
| SDXL CLIP-G | Stable Diffusion CLIP-G | 1280D | Direct ComfyUI conditioning for prompts, tags & captions |

**Embedding Model Breakdown**:
- **BGE-large-en-v1.5**: Text-only embeddings optimized for retrieval. Used for prompt/tag/caption similarity search.
- **CLIP-ViT-H/14**: Multi-modal vision-language model for image-to-image visual similarity. Integrates with ComfyUI's IPAdapter for semantic image generation.
- **CLIP-L & CLIP-G**: Native SDXL text encoders for direct conditioning. Embed your prompts, tags, and captions in SDXL-compatible vector space for generation workflows.

**Benefits**:
- "Find images like this" visual search with CLIP-ViT-H
- Natural language search ("dramatic lighting at sunset") via BGE embeddings
- Direct export to ComfyUI for SDXL generation with CLIP-L/G conditioning
- IPAdapter-compatible embeddings for semantic image variations
- Multi-modal hybrid search (text + visual combined)

## 🔄 Batch Image Conversion (WebP)

**Why**: Save disk space on large collections without manual conversion.

**What Changed**:
- New "Convert Images to WebP..." context menu option
- WebP Lossy (smaller) and Lossless (perfect quality) modes
- Quality slider (50-100%)
- Automatic metadata preservation during conversion
- Real-time progress with space-saved calculation
- Optional original file deletion with confirmation

**Benefits**:
- 20-70% space savings depending on source format
- Preserves all generation parameters and tags
- Database paths automatically updated
- Non-destructive with metadata backup

## 🔧 Architecture Improvements

### Service Layer Refactoring
- `ServiceLocator` pattern for dependency access
- `DatabaseWriterService` with async queue (System.Threading.Channels)
- `ScanningService` with cancellation token propagation
- Folder cache pre-loading to avoid query conflicts during bulk operations
- Thread-safe lazy initialization for FileSystemWatcher handlers

### Code Organization
- Partial classes split by feature (MainWindow.xaml.*.cs)
- Modular project structure (15+ projects)
- PostgreSQL models separate from SQLite models
- Type aliases for disambiguation (`PgSorting`, `PgPaging`)

### Settings & Navigation UX

- Settings page additions:
   - Caption Provider selection + fields for external provider (Base URL, Model, API Key)
   - “Test Connection” and “Send Sample Image” utilities
   - Model field upgraded to an editable ComboBox populated from the `/models` endpoint
   - Model Root path management with “Scan Models” (registers typical model subfolders)
   - Collection (schema) switcher with quick “Create Schema” action for multi‑collection setups
- Settings button moved from the left sidebar to the top toolbar for quicker access; dirty indicator (red dot) follows the button.

### Error Handling
- Global exception handler with logging
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Graceful degradation when optional features unavailable
- Diagnostic logging for troubleshooting
